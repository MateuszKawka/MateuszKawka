### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mateusz Kawka - I'm a student of the Gdansk School of Banking
in the field of engineering web applications / Front-End Developer. I am
interested in broadly understood computer science, programming, old
hip-hop music and synthwave, to a small extent also history and stock
market speculation. I love to read books. I love animals, recently I own
a beautiful dog from a shelter in Elblag.

I started my adventure with programming almost 5 years ago with the book
`HTML and CSS. Design and build a web site`, which I reworked in 3 days,
practically without leaving my computer. At the beginning I didn't plan
to tie my career with programming, but as time went by I started to make
sure that this is something I want to do in my life. Now I know it's
100%
